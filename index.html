Your social footprint is microscopic, and romantic prospects are scarce—but that’s reality, not failure. Self-improvement isn’t about chasing validation; it’s about building a life that works for you. Strengthen your mind, gather knowledge, and become self-sufficient. It isn’t about chasing validation; it’s about crafting a life that doesn’t suck even if nobody else notices. Watch videos or read about people worse off—health-wise, intellect-wise, or wealth-wise—to shift your window of reference and soften the sting of reality. The brain keeps track of where we stand in hierarchies, focusing only on those who have it better inevitably leads to depression holes. Don't be gaslit by normies and looksmaxers into thinking your true value is decided by what the opposite sex thinks you are worth. Don't completely isolate, online friends are real people. Remember: it’s never over until the fat lady sings… but can something that never began really be over?";

Your interactions may feel awkward, and conversations with others may feel like pulling water out of a stone. They seem to not be putting in any effort despite your attempts. You don't get much negative attention but also not much positive either. Do not become a socially isolated node IRL if you still have hope. Explore niches to try and get into a community of something you actually enjoy. If hardmaxxing is not an option, do not underestimate steady small incremental improvements, maybe one day you penetrate into normie territory. It is up to you to calculate if the time investment is worth it. Jestermaxxing at this stage may not produce dividends, so it isn't recommended. True unbiased assessment of your situation and what you may still improve is highly valuable at this stage, but don't fall for grifters. Never take advice of someone more privileged or better looking. Value any meaningful bonds you may still have as forming new ones may be a near impossible task.";

Classic self-improvement: physical fitness, hobbies, going outside, grooming, style, and financial independence may actually give some results for you. Stay alert for unexpected social openings or opportunities as they may happen to you IRL or online, but may be rare. Your efforts set the stage for possible ascension. You are a salmon swimming against the current but have good odds to move forward.";
